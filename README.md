### Hello!

🇦🇺 I'm Kadison McLellan, an Australian university student who aspires to be a software developer.

🚀 My biggest goal is to better my everyday life and productivity. I like to make systems and simplify my life because if I can make something as easy as possible for myself, I'm more likely to do it. I mean we optimise code all the time, so why not optimise our life right?

🌟 This is why I try to make projects that can improve quality of life for myself and others. Even if it is only a small improvement.
